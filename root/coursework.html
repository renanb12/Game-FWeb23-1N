                The Scream is a composition created by Norwegian artist Edvard Munch in 1893. The Norwegian name of the
                piece is Skrik (Scream), and the
                German title under which it was first exhibited is Der Schrei der Natur (The Scream of Nature). The
                agonized face in the painting has become
                one of the most iconic images in art, seen as symbolizing the anxiety of the human condition. Munch's
                work, including The Scream, had a
                formative influence on the Expressionist movement.[1]
                Munch recalled that he had been out for a walk at sunset when suddenly the setting sun's light turned
                the clouds "a blood red".
                He sensed an "infinite scream passing through nature". Scholars have located the spot to a fjord
                overlooking Oslo[2] and have suggested other
                explanations for the unnaturally orange sky, ranging from the effects of a volcanic eruption to a
                psychological reaction by Munch to his
                sister's commitment at a nearby lunatic asylum.
